# The Banana accounting software
The Botangisi association works closely with Banana.ch SA, a Swiss software company specialised in accouting. Since 2018, this firm has kindely provided free licences of its accounting software to the Ministry of Primary, Secondary and Technical Education of DRC. Public and private schools in DRC have since been able to integrate the teaching of digital accouting in their curriculum. We also supported the Ministry in the training of the teachers within the different provinces of the country.

At the end of 2022 a scientific article has been published by Kitenge Kalume Deogratias, Mandela Nsengiyumva David and Muleka Kipanga Celestin about the use of the Banana accounting software in Lubumbashi.

Survey and questionnaire methods, allowed us to collect the data relating to our investigations. Out of a total number of 131 schools identified organizing the Commercial and Management Section, 39 were selected on the basis of the following criteria: the presence of computer tools, the presence of terminal classes of this option and the presence of teachers with knowledge of the Banana Accounting software. After data collection and analysis of the data, the results recorded showed on the one hand that all the teachers actually have knowledge of the existence of banana accounting software and this, following a mode of learning (seminar or self-training) and on the other hand, 74.4% of these teachers have effectively integrated the teaching of the software under discussion, while the remainder, i.e. 25.6%, teach the use of the software without integrating it into their material predictions. In addition, 66.7% of teachers mentioned difficulties in teaching this software particularly due to the insufficiency of the computer tools available allowing a good transmission of the concepts related to this software, to the non-existence of manuals containing the appropriate concepts. Banana accounting software and the instability of the electric current. Despite all these difficulties, only 5.1% of students fail to master the concepts related to this software. Regarding the schools management mode that met the criteria, the results show that the majority of the schools selected (76.9%) operate under the approved private system, while 23.1%; have a public management system (official and contracted) and as regards gender, the majority of the selected schools teachers (92.3%), who teach computer science in the Lubumbashi 1 sub-division, are male against a minority women (7.7%)."
