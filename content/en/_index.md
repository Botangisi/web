# Botangisi

The word **Botangisi** means "teaching" in Lingala, a Bantu language spoken in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The use of the term Botangisi includes both teaching and learning, describing more of a group action of teachers and students. This is how the Botangisi association desires to be positioned: at the heart of a participative act of education that considers different parts, those who deploy the teachings and those who receive them.

## Our vision
The vision of the Botangisi association is deeply rooted in digital innovation. We want to support educational facilities in the development of digital means, for online teaching and to equip students with digital skills for their professional careers.
We spread our support within areas that are not yet furnished in digital technologies or that don't have the budget for the current technology market. We work then towards the sharing of digital tools and the research and develpoment of technologies adapted to those specific context.
