## The term Botangisi

The term Botangisi means teaching in [lingala](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_lingala), a Bantu language spoken in Congo.  
In line with African culture with more marked accents towards group logic, the verb *botangisi* also involves an action on the part of the student. Teaching is, therefore, a joint action between teacher and student. 

Teaching is therefore a common action between teacher and student.
